# news_and_stocks

Utilization of AWS NLS and alpha vantage to find trends between news sentiment and a stock price
Pre-requiste:

pip install alpha_vantage –user
pip install webhoseio –user
sudo yum install python-tools
sudo yum install python3-tkinter
install matplotlib from source

install aws-cli:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html

install java-sdk

sign up for aws free account, newsapi and webhose io 

Since I only had the free development plan, the day range to choose news is only one month so when you are using the news api, you can just type None.
The API Keys are already in webhose.py and get_news_in_json.java
